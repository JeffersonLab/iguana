# Iguana

**I**mplementation **Gu**ardian of **An**alysis **A**lgorithms

- Preserve and centralize common analysis algorithms, such as
  - Fiducial cuts
  - Momentum corrections
  - Kinematics reconstruction
- Focused on HIPO data (CLAS12), but extending support to other data formats (experiments) is feasible
- This is not a framework for _reading_ data, rather it is a set of algorithms to _mutate_ the data
