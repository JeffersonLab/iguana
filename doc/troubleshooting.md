# Troubleshooting Notes

- if you redirect `stdout` and `stderr` to a file, you may notice that `stderr` lines are out-of-order with respect to the `stdout` lines; for example:
```bash
myAnalysisProgram                    # stdout and stderr print when they happen; ordering appears correct

myAnalysisProgram |& tee output.txt  # stderr prints when it happens, but stdout only prints when its buffer is full;
                                     # ordering appears mixed up
```
To redirect output to a file with the ordering preserved, run your executable with `stdout` unbuffered:
```bash
stdbuf -o0 myAnalysisProgram |& tee output.txt
```
