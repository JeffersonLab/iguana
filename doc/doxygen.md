# Iguana API Documentation

This documentation shows how to use the Iguana classes.

For additional documentation and examples, [see the main README](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/iguana/blob/main/README.md)

# List of Algorithms

The algorithms are organized into **namespaces**; click the links to view each of their algorithms.

| Namespace         | Description                                                   |
| ---               | ---                                                           |
| `iguana::clas12`  | Algorithms specific to CLAS12 experimental data               |
| `iguana::physics` | Physics algorithms, which may be more generalized than CLAS12 |
| `iguana::example` | Example algorithms                                            |
