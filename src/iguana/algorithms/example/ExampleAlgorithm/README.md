# Example Algorithm Template

This directory includes a fully documented, simple example algorithm:
- Algorithm implementation: [`Algorithm.h`](Algorithm.h) and [`Algorithm.cc`](Algorithm.cc)
- Algorithm configuration: [`Config.yaml`](Config.yaml)

> [!NOTE]
> The filenames must be consistent (_e.g._, `Algorithm.h` for the algorithm header), but you are free to add additional files and subdirectories as needed

In this code, the following comment styles are used:
- `// #`: this is a comment which describes in detail what each line of the code does; you probably
  don't want this much detail in your own algorithm
- `///`: this is a `docstring` for [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/), for automated documentation generation;
  you'll need to use these when documenting your algorithm

To generate a starter algorithm (without the `// #` comments) so you may get
started coding, run the `make_starter.sh` script here:
```bash
# run with no arguments to see usage
src/iguana/algorithms/example/make_starter.sh

# example: make a CLAS12 algorithm called AwesomeAlgorithm
src/iguana/algorithms/example/make_starter.sh AwesomeAlgorithm clas12
```

Once you have generated your new algorithm:
- [ ] add it to the [appropriate `meson.build` file](/src/iguana/algorithms/meson.build), so your algorithm is built
- [ ] add your algorithm files and your name (GitHub handle or email address) to the [`CODEOWNERS` file](/CODEOWNERS)
- [ ] consider writing a **Validator** algorithm, for example, one that draws validation plots used to check if your algorithm is working;
      see existing algorithms for examples
- [ ] if you created a new namespace, update [`namespaces.dox`](/doc/doxygen/namespaces.dox)
- [ ] if your algorithm uses a particle bank, and can support not only `REC::Particle` but also banks such as `MC::Particle`, make sure
      that this is possible; see `physics::InclusiveKinematics` for an example of what to do

> [!TIP]
> Enable the build option `install_documentation` (if you have `doxygen`), so
> that `meson` will generate the documentation locally. Documentation is
> automatically generated by the Continuous Integration (CI), but if you
> generate it locally, it can help you more quickly fix any documentation
> errors, and will allow you to _see_ the documentation before it's deployed
> online.

> [!TIP]
> Enable debugging symbols when building by setting the Iguana build option `buildtype` to `debug`.
