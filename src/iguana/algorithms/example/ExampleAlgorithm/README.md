# Example Algorithm Template

This directory includes a fully documented, simple example algorithm:
- Algorithm implementation: [`Algorithm.h`](Algorithm.h) and [`Algorithm.cc`](Algorithm.cc)
- Algorithm configuration: [`Config.yaml`](Config.yaml)

> [!NOTE]
> The filenames must be consistent (_e.g._, `Algorithm.h` for the algorithm header), but you are free to add additional files and subdirectories as needed

In this code, the following comment styles are used:
- `// #`: this is a comment which describes in detail what each line of the code does; you probably
  don't want this much detail in your own algorithm
- `///`: this is a `docstring` for [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/), for automated documentation generation;
  you'll need to use these when documenting your algorithm

To generate a starter algorithm (without the `// #` comments) so you may get
started coding, run the `make_starter.sh` script here:
```bash
# run with no arguments to see usage
src/iguana/algorithms/example/make_starter.sh

# example: make a CLAS12 algorithm called AwesomeAlgorithm
src/iguana/algorithms/example/make_starter.sh AwesomeAlgorithm clas12
```

Once you have generated your new algorithm:
- [ ] add it to the [appropriate `meson.build` file](/src/iguana/algorithms/meson.build), so your algorithm is built
- [ ] add your algorithm files and your name (GitHub handle or email address) to the [`CODEOWNERS` file](/CODEOWNERS)
- [ ] consider writing a **Validator** algorithm, for example, one that draws validation plots used to check if your algorithm is working;
      see existing algorithms for examples, and [documentation here](/doc/testing.md)
- [ ] if you created a new namespace, update [`Docstrings.h`](/src/iguana/algorithms/Docstrings.h)

> [!TIP]
> Enable debugging symbols when building by setting the Iguana build option `buildtype` to `debug`.
