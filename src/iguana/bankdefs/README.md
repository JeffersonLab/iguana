# Iguana Bank Definitions

Creator algorithms create new banks; the files in this directory describe the new banks, in particular, [`iguana.json`](iguana.json).

This `json` file follows the same format as the `coatjava` bank definitions and may be used as a reference; this `json` file is also installed in `etc/iguana/bankdefs/`.
