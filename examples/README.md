# Examples

All of the examples (`*.cc`) in this directory may be built using the
`--examples` option of `configure.py`; they will be installed in the `bin/`
subdirectory of your `iguana` installation.

The `build_with_*/` subdirectories are standalone examples demonstrating how to
build an executable that depends on `iguana` libraries. You may use these to
help understand how to include `iguana` as a dependency of your own projects.
