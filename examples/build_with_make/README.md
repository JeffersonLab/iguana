# Example Building with a Makefile

This example demonstrates how to build an executable that depends on `iguana`, using a `Makefile`

- `Makefile`: the file used to build this example
- `test.sh`: demonstration of _how_ to build and run this example
  - this script is _used by the CI_, and is _not_ meant to be used locally
  - note that you will need to customize how dependencies are found
