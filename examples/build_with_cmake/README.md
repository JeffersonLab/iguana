# Example Building with CMake

This example [`CMakeLists.txt`](CMakeLists.txt) demonstrates how to build an executable that depends on `iguana`.

See [note on dependency resolution](../../doc/dependency_resolution.md) first.
Then you may use the `find_package()` and `pkg_check_modules()` commands to include dependencies.
